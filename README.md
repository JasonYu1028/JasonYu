# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Hi, I'm Jason! I'm an undergraduate pursuing Bechlor of [Computing and Financial Management](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computing-and-financial-management) that I would like to describe as computational finance at the University of Waterloo.

I'm dedicated to utilze various sorts of techniques, such as popular programming languages (**Python**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **HTML** ...), prevelent frameworks (**React**, **ML**, **AI** ...), and practical developer tools, in solving real-world issues no matter in software, finance, or other industries to benefit the interests of human beings.

If you're willing to know more about me, go check out [my perosnal website](https://jasonyu.live/) that shows the real me!

Also, you could check out my projects [here](https://github.com/JasonYu1028?tab=repositories)!
